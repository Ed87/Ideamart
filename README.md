## Usage
#### SMS API
```c#
SmsAPI smsAPI = new SmsAPI("APP_ID", "App_Password")
            {
                IsInProduction = false
            };
```
Change `IsInProduction` property value to `true` if you  are using ideamart emulator. this must be `false` in production environment.

##### Send an SMS
Note: User must have subscribed to an application to receive messages. 
```c#
//text message to be sent
string msg = "Hello from ideamart api";
//mobile hash of the user
List<string> numbers = new List<string>()
{
    "Mobile hash"
};
var result = await smsAPI.SendSmsAsync(msg, number);
```
`SendSmsAsync` is an asynchronous task which returns a instance of `SmsStatusResponse` object. 

#### USSD API
##### Invoke a USSD menu
When a user dials USSD short code (#775*xxx#), Ideamart platform sends a HTTP POST request to your application (to the `Connection URL` which you given when provisioning). It'll be `mo-init`, `mo-cont` or `mo-fin` USSD request. based on which USSD operation request user has made, your application should respond. Please refer [Ideamart USSD documentation](http://www.ideamart.lk/web/idea-pro/documentation/idea-pro/ussd-api/) for more details.
```c#
UssdAPI ussdAPI = new UssdAPI("APP_ID", "App_Password")
{
    IsInProduction = true
};
```
Create a USSD menu on user mobile
```c#
string msg = "Welcome to my app!\r\n1. Action one\r\n2. Action 2\r\n3. Action three";
UssdStatusReponse statusReponse = await ussdAPI.SendRequestAsync(msg, "SessionID", UssdAPI.UssdOperation.mt_cont, "MobileHash");
```

#### Subscription API
##### User Subsctiption with Subscription API
```c#
var subscriptionApi = new SubscriptionAPI("APP_ID", "App_Password")
{
    IsInProduction = true
};
```

##### Send user subscription request
```c#
SubscriptionResponse subscriptionResponse = await subscriptionApi.SendSubscriptionRequestAsync("Mobile_Hash", SubscriptionAPI.SubscriptionAction.Subscribe);
```

##### Send unsubscription request
```c#
SubscriptionResponse subscriptionResponse = await subscriptionApi.SendSubscriptionRequestAsync("Mobile_Hash", SubscriptionAPI.SubscriptionAction.Unsubscribe);
```
Both subscription and unsubscription requests return an instance of `SubscriptionResponse`

##### Query Subscribers base
```c#
//make the request
SubscriptionStatusResponse subscriptionStatus = await subscriptionApi.RequestSubscriptionStatusAsync("Mobile_Hash");
//get the status of current subscription
string status = subscriptionStatus.subscriptionStatus;
```
